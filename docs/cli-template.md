# üß† CLI

`playground` CLI is available in `scripts/cli/playground`.
It makes so much easier to use the playground and reduces a lot the Docker knowledge required !

## üöú Setup

### ü¶∂ Setup PATH

Add it to your `PATH` environment variable by adding this in your `~/.bashrc` or `~/.zshrc`:

```bash
export PATH=/path/to/kafka-docker-playground/scripts/cli:$PATH
```

> [!WARNING]
> The bash script generated by [bashly](https://bashly.dannyb.co/) can run in any shell, but require that bash 4 or higher is installed.
> Mac users can upgrade bash by running `brew install bash`

### ‚ö° Setup completion

A Bash completion file is also available in `scripts/cli/completions.bash`.

In order to be able to use completion with the CLI, you just need to add this in your `~/.bashrc` or `~/.zshrc`:

```bash
source /path/to/kafka-docker-playground/scripts/cli/completions.bash
```

> [!NOTE]
> If you use ZSH, but **not** `Oh-My-Zsh`, please check [this](https://bashly.dannyb.co/advanced/bash-completion/#completions-in-zsh).

### ü™Ñ Setup Shell Script Command Completion Visual Studio Code extension

Get nice [IntelliSense](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/ide/using-intellisense?view=vs-2022) completion for `playground` CLI in Visual Studio Code ! It uses a slightly modified version of "Shell Script Command Completion" Visual Studio Code extension (https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=tetradresearch.vscode-h2o):

### ü§ñ Setup MCP server for Playground CLI

You can use it with any MCP Client (Github Copilot, Claude desktop, Cursor, etc...)

#### Features

- **Command Completion**: Auto-complete playground commands with context-aware suggestions
- **Command Help**: Get detailed help for any playground command or subcommand  
- **Command Validation**: Validate playground commands before execution

#### installation for Visual Studio Code (Github Copilot)

Add in `.vscode/mcp.json`:

```json
{
	"servers": {
		"playground": {
		"command": "docker",
		"args": [
			"run", "--rm", "-i",
			"vdesabou/mcp-playground-server:latest",
			"node", "dist/index.js"
		]
		}
	},
	"inputs": []
}
```

Start the server if not already started:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "playground": {
      "args": [
        "run",
        "--rm",
        "-i",
        "vdesabou/mcp-playground-server:latest",
