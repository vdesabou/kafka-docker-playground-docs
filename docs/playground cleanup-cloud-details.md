# playground cleanup-cloud-details

🧼 playground is actively caching ccloud details (https://kafka-docker-playground.io/#/how-to-use?id=%f0%9f%8c%a4%ef%b8%8f-confluent-cloud-examples)  
   use this command if you notice that the playground is using unexpected ccloud details  
  
Drops the cached environment, cluster, endpoints and API keys, so the next  
ccloud example re-discovers them from scratch. Typically needed after you  
changed of Confluent Cloud organisation, or deleted the cluster from the UI  
behind the playground's back.  
  
❕ Nothing is deleted in Confluent Cloud, only the local cache. To delete  
   the cloud resources themselves, see 'playground cleanup-cloud-resources'.

## Usage

```bash
playground cleanup-cloud-details
```
