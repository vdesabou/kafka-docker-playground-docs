# playground switch-ccloud

🌩️  Switch to ccloud environment.  
  
It will bootstrap ccloud environment based on your previously ran ccloud example.  
  
Points the CLI at the Confluent Cloud cluster of your last ccloud run, so  
that 'playground topic', 'playground connector' and 'playground schema'  
talk to Confluent Cloud instead of the local containers. Nothing is  
created or destroyed, and no container is started or stopped.  
  
❕ Requires that you ran a ccloud example at least once, so that the  
   environment, cluster and credentials are cached in playground.ini.  
   The environment you were on is remembered for 'playground switch-back'.

## Usage

playground switch-ccloud
