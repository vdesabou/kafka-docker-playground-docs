# playground switch-podman

🦭 Switch the container engine to Podman  
  
Points the 'docker' CLI, 'docker compose' and the playground at the rootful  
Podman socket, through a 'podman' docker context: the switch applies to your  
current shell and to new ones, with nothing to export. On macOS the podman  
machine is started if needed. Ends with 'playground doctor'.  
  
Containers are not moved between engines: stop the running example first.  
  
❕ Podman must be set up once, see  
   https://kafka-docker-playground.io/#/how-to-use?id=🦭-using-podman-instead-of-docker  
   The docker context you were on is remembered for 'playground switch-docker'.
